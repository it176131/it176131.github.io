Hello! ðŸ‘‹
My name is Ian and this is my website.
I initially started it because I thought I could maintain a blog, but I don't think I post enough.
Oh well. ðŸ¤·

My inspiration came from a book called [_What Would Google Do?_](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/5100525-what-would-google-do) by Jeff Jarvis.
Somewhere in the book Jeff compares paper and digital publications, and the main thing I remember is that digital is a lot easier to update post-release.
So I decided to start a blog and share my coding and data science journey, and whatever else I wouldn't be embarrassed to post online.
Of course, I still keep a paper journal because I love the feeling of a felt-tip pen on 120 g/m$^2$ paper and a bookshelf full of handwritten thoughts is kind of impressive to look at.

But who am _I_?
That's something I've been trying to answer for a long time.
Professionally, I've been called a mathematician, statistician, data scientist, analyst, and consultantâ€”in no particular order.
I earned a Bachelor of Science in mathematics from Kansas State University in 2015.
Attended graduate school for about eight weeks before dropping out to take a job in Kansas City, where I still live today.
I don't know if I'll stay in KC forever, but I haven't found a good reason to move quite yet.

I try to read more books each year, tracking my count with [goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/user_challenges/47793517).
This year my goal is 18.
I figure if I set a minimum goal of one more book than I read the prior year, and then beat that by at least one, I'll have read a lot more books than the average person.
