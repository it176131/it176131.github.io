### Career
#### Senior Data Scientist @ H&R Block
04/2022—present
- Developed a proof of concept to convert tax instructions into a 
  directed acyclic graph using named entity recognition and a key file.
- Using topological sorting within a directed acyclic graph, predicted
  hundreds of tax lines in parallel within the same generation. 
- Through the use of graph algorithms, developed methods to quickly 
  identify which lines in a tax form impacted other lines.
- Published the subpackage, "ReturnAssistant," with the ability to 
  process 60,000 prior year returns in ~200ms.
- Crawled the IRS website, extracted instructions for all forms and 
  schedules, and preprocessed into training data.
- Developed and trained a relation extraction pipeline to automate 
  the construction of a directed acyclic graph using a custom 
  tokenizer, a fine-tuned named entity recognition component, and a 
  custom trained relation extraction component.
- Participated in the generative artificial intelligence research and 
  development team.
- Developed a package to help navigate and validate the company tax
  engine using graph algorithms.

#### Data Scientist Principal @ The University of Kansas Health System
10/2021—04/2022
- Automated PRM ticket creation saving 100 minutes per month.
- Introduced Gaussian Processes (Kriging) as a data generation
  technique to estimate values where observations were not recorded in
  a time series.
- Created and maintained a private Python package to streamline my
  team's work.

#### Business Intelligence Statistician II @ The University of Kansas Health System
06/2019—10/2021
- Deployed a classification model via API to label cost accounting
  codes with 95% accuracy, shortening manual labeling time from 3 hours
  to seconds widening the user-base.
- Automated weekly JIRA tickets, time checks, and comment reminders
  using Python and the JIRA API saving 100 minutes per week.
- Using a topic model, trained a named entity recognition pipeline on
  charge code descriptions to identify profitable subsets.
- Cut average costs per primary complete mastectomy from $9,000 to
  $5,500 using evidence provided via bootstrapping and difference
  testing.
- Deconstructed and rebuilt the COVID-19 CHIME model using internal
  data, providing an auto-updating dashboard to senior leadership to
  help with capacity and supply planning.

#### Statistician @ Cerner Corporation
05/2017—05/2019
- Designed and automated standard analyses, updating PowerPoint
  presentations directly.
- Simulated and optimized complex rule-based algorithms for
  patient-provider matching.
- Lead quarterly Python classes to teach and train associates.
- Implemented quality-improvement benchmarks for health systems using a
  combination of the
  [Achievable Benchmarks of Care](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10461579/){:target="_blank"}
  and mathematically derived metrics.
- Developed a Python module to generate and execute SQL, allowing the
  validation of data sets and simulation of changes.
