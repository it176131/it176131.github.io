Hello! ðŸ‘‹
My name is Ian and this is my website.
I initially started it because I thought I could maintain a blog, but I don't think I post enough.
Oh well. ðŸ¤·

My inspiration came from a book called [_What Would Google Do?_](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/5100525-what-would-google-do) by Jeff Jarvis.
Somewhere in the book Jeff compares paper and digital publications, and the main thing I remember is that digital is a lot easier to update post-release.
Of course, I still keep a paper journal because I love the feeling of a felt-tip pen on 120gsm paper, but a blog sounded cool especially for tracking my coding and data science journey.
On and spell check.
