Hello! ðŸ‘‹
My name is Ian and this is my website.
I initially started it because I thought I could maintain a blog, but I don't think I post enough.
Oh well. ðŸ¤·

My inspiration came from a book called [_What Would Google Do?_](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/5100525-what-would-google-do) by Jeff Jarvis.
Somewhere in the book Jeff compares paper and digital publications, and the main thing I remember is that digital is a lot easier to update post-release.
So I decided to start a blog and share my coding and data science journey, and whatever else I wouldn't be embarrassed to share online.
Of course, I still keep a paper journal because I love the feeling of a felt-tip pen on 120 g/m$^2$ paper and a bookshelf full of handwritten thoughts is kind of impressive to look at.
