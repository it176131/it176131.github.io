Hello! ðŸ‘‹
My name is Ian and this is my website.
I initially started it because I thought I could maintain a blog, but I don't think I post enough.
Oh well. ðŸ¤·

My inspiration came from a book called [_What Would Google Do?_](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/5100525-what-would-google-do) by Jeff Jarvis.
In it, Jeff brings up a valid pointâ€”paper publications can't be edited after they're released.
You could release a new edition, but that can be expensive especially if there's only one or two things to fix.
With digital writing, everything can be changed quickly and cheaply.
Sounded like a good enough reason to start a blog.
