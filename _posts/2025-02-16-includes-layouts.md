I think this post will be short.
It will start with a recap of my [_2024:
Year in Review_]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _posts/2025-01-31-year-in-review.md %})
post where I mentioned wanting to write better posts and track web traffic.
From there I'll introduce that I'm using [Google Analytics](https://developers.google.com/analytics).

To use Google Analytics I need to add an HTML `<script>` element to all of my posts just below the `<head>` tag.
This raised a problem—a large number of my posts are written in [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown),
which means I don't have a direct ability to add/modify the HTML with the Google Analytics `<script>`.

I knew
that [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) performed a conversion of my Markdown to HTML before being deployed/published.
This lead me to search for the "template" used by Jekyll for my posts, and later, for all pages on my site.

With some digging I discovered the `_includes/` and `_layouts/` directories.
The `_layouts/` directory houses the "templates" used by Jekyll to convert my pages to HTML.
The `_includes/` directory holds snippets of HTML that don't do anything by themselves,
but can augment the HTML in a layout template if "included."

This is where [front matter](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/front-matter/) at the top of each post started to make sense.
On any given post on my blog you'll find a section at the top called _front matter_.
Its job is to tell Jekyll _how to format this Markdown when converting to HTML_.

It's represented as a block of yaml-like text enclosed by three dashes on top and bottom.
For example:
```yaml

front matter goes here!

```

All of my posts have the following front matter keys at a minimum:
- `layout`
- `title`
- `date`

I've (almost) always set the layout to "post"
because that's what the [GitHub Pages tutorial](https://github.com/skills/github-pages)
(course?) said to do.
I think the only time I didn't was for my [résumé](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/it176131/it176131.github.io/refs/heads/main/resume.md) when I set the layout to "page".

After finding a file called _post.html_ in the `_layouts/` directory
and seeing a very similar HTML structure to my already-published posts,
I gathered that this was the template Jekyll was using to format my posts
(or at least any page that the layout set to "post" in the front matter).

The _page.html_ has references to files in the `_includes/` directory with includes tags.
This would be how I could automatically add the Google Analytics `<script>` element to every page on my site.
But of course, to include it on every page meant using the top-most HTML file rather than the _post.html_ because...

After creating an `analytics.html` file in my own repo's `_includes/` directory,
I referenced it in my `_includes/head.html` file.
With a quick refresh of my local Jekyll server and an inspection of a couple of my site's pages,
I could see the Google Analytics `<script>`.
It had worked!

I pushed all of my changes to GitHub and merged with my main branch.
After deployment I checked my live-site and again saw the script.
I felt like I had unlocked a level in my understanding of Jekyll, GitHub Pages, and HTML.

I completed all of this on February 1, 2025—the day after I published [_2024:
Year in Review_]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _posts/2025-01-31-year-in-review.md %}).
For the last couple of weeks I've been looking at my site's web traffic.
It's been enjoyable to see.
I don't have a lot of visitors; maybe one or two a day with most of them going to my more recent posts.
But it feels good to be seen.

In January 2024, when my site was a few posts old, I added the ability to comment and react to my posts via [giscuss](https://giscus.app/).
After adding Google Analytics to my `_includes/` and letting Jekyll handle the automation,
I figured it was hightime to do the same with my comments.

Yes,
I've literally been copy/pasting an HTML script to the bottom of every post
since I published [_Comments_]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _posts/2024-01-10-comments.md %}).
It's been tedious, and I've accidentally published multiple times without the script,
having to go back and add it after the fact.
It's not that I didn't want to automate it
—I considered writing a pre-commit hook to check for it—I just didn't know how.
