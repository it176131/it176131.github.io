I was today years old when I learned how to use the command [`git mv`](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-mv).
It's not a challenging command to understand,
but sometimes doing things the hard way makes the shortcuts more enjoyable.
Case in point, [my most recent blog post]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _posts/2025-03-28-innovation-week.md %}).

# The "hard" way
At the end of [_Resurrection_]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _posts/2025-03-28-innovation-week.md#resurrection %}),
just before [_Three years later..._]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _posts/2025-03-28-innovation-week.md#three-years-later %}), there's a code block where I move my newly merged `not-dead/` subdirectory to a `libs/` directory.
Here's how it was done.
<blockquote>
Copied from my blog...

```shell
# We're still inside the mono/ repo...
$ mkdir libs
$ mv not-dead libs/
$ git add . && git commit  # Don't forget to commit the directory movement!
```
</blockquote>

It's an easy one, two, three (four if you separate `git add` and `git commit`) steps.
1. Make the `libs/` directory (assuming it doesn't already exist).
2. Move the `not-dead/` directory inside the `libs/` directory.
3. Add the changes with `git` (not doing this makes it look like `not-dead/` directory was deleted and a new, untracked `libs/not-dead/` directory was created).
4. Commit changes.

But what if we could cut it down to two?

# The shortcut
Let's pretend we didn't run any of the commands in the previous section and start fresh.
```shell
# We're still inside the mono/ repo...
$ git mv not-dead/ libs/
$ git commit
```

That's it!
Everything we did the "hard" way can be achieved in those two lines.
Even better, we could combine them into a single line:
```shell
# We're still inside the mono/ repo...
$ git mv not-dead/ libs/ && git commit
```

Isn't that convenient?
