2023 was one for the books.
It's crazy to think so much happened in what feels like such a short amount of time.
Let's see if I can organize it chronologically.

I'm sure I missed a few things along the wayâ€”had to use my photo album to remind me of things that happened.

# A couple honorable mentions:
- I read 17 books (goal was 16) -- nearly half were in the time between my accident (November 20) and New Year's Eve (December 31).
- Invited to join a generative AI R&D team at work.
- Finalizing details for a patent I submitted in August of 2022.

As I start the new year, I plan to continue publishing to my blog with stories, projects, thoughts, and the occasional tangent.
I hope to improve my writing, and use the blog as a public record to keep me disciplined in pursuing my goals.
