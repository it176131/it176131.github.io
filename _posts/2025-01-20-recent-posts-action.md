First post of 2025!

I ended 2024 with my post, [_pydantic-xml: Parsing My RSS Feed_]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _posts/2024-12-23-pydantic-xml.md %}),
and mentioned that I was trying to add my most recent blog post to my GitHub profile using a custom GitHub action and workflow.
I'm happy to share that after a couple of weeks, I figured it out. üòé

I won't bore you with every struggle I experienced.
Instead, I'll share what files I had to create,
how they interact with each other from a high level,
and then give a (mostly) line-by-line breakdown of the important stuff.

# The files
All together, I created four new files and modified two others:

|          | File                                                             |
|----------|------------------------------------------------------------------|
| New      | action.yml<br>Dockerfile<br>recent-posts.yml<br>requirements.txt |
| Modified | main.py<br>README.md                                             |

The files are across two repos,
my [blog repo](https://github.com/it176131/it176131.github.io) and my [profile repo](https://github.com/it176131/it176131).
This organizes things and allows me
to keep the [_action_](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/about-github-actions/understanding-github-actions#actions) in the blog repo,
and the [_workflow_](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/about-github-actions/understanding-github-actions#workflows) in the profile repo.

Here is the layout of my two repos.
```
üìÇ it176131.github.io  # blog repo
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ üìÇ .github
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ üìÇ actions
        ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ üìÇ recent-posts
            ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ üîß action.yml  # The action metadata file
            ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ üêã Dockerfile  # Instructions to build the Docker container
            ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ üêç main.py  # Python script to update the input (README.md)
            ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ üìÑ requirements.txt  # Python package dependencies for main.py

üìÇ it176131  # profile repo
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ üìÇ .github
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ üìÇ workflows
‚îÇ       ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ üîß recent-posts.yml  # The workflow file
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ üìì README.md  # My "profile"
```

# The interactions
There are six interactions among the files that result in the `README.md` being updated.
Because the files have unique names, I will reference them as if they were local to each other.
For example, I will reference `it176131/.github/workflows/recent-posts.yml` as `recent-posts.yml`.
> For your convenience, each file name will have a [tooltip ‚ÑπÔ∏è](## "Hover over the filenames") with the full path so you can keep them straight üòâ.

1. [_recent-posts.yml_ ‚ÑπÔ∏è](## "it176131/.github/workflows/recent-posts.yml") checks out the repository, giving it access to [_README.md_ ‚ÑπÔ∏è](## "it176131/README.md").
2. [_recent-posts.yml_ ‚ÑπÔ∏è](## "it176131/.github/workflows/recent-posts.yml") calls [_action.yml_ ‚ÑπÔ∏è](## "it176131.github.io/.github/actions/recent-posts/action.yml") with inputs `readme` (default [_README.md_ ‚ÑπÔ∏è](## "it176131/README.md")) and `num-entries` (default `5`).
3. [_action.yml_ ‚ÑπÔ∏è](## "it176131.github.io/.github/actions/recent-posts/action.yml") informs GitHub
   to build a Docker container using the [_Dockerfile_ ‚ÑπÔ∏è](## "it176131.github.io/.github/actions/recent-posts/Dockerfile").
4. The Docker container produced by [_Dockerfile_ ‚ÑπÔ∏è](## "it176131.github.io/.github/actions/recent-posts/Dockerfile") installs the packages in [_requirements.txt_ ‚ÑπÔ∏è](## "it176131.github.io/.github/actions/recent-posts/requirements.txt") and runs [_main.py_ ‚ÑπÔ∏è](## "it176131.github.io/.github/actions/recent-posts/main.py") with the inputs from *step 1*.
5. [_main.py_ ‚ÑπÔ∏è](## "it176131.github.io/.github/actions/recent-posts/main.py") takes the inputs and updates the [_README.md_ ‚ÑπÔ∏è](## "it176131/README.md") with the latest posts.
6. [_recent-posts.yml_ ‚ÑπÔ∏è](## "it176131/.github/workflows/recent-posts.yml") checks if [_README.md_ ‚ÑπÔ∏è](## "it176131/README.md") has been modified, commiting and pushing any changes.

That's quite a bit of interaction.
Let's open up the files and see what's going on under the hood.

# The breakdown
I'll start with [_recent-posts.yml_ ‚ÑπÔ∏è](## "it176131/.github/workflows/recent-posts.yml")
as it's the first file referenced in _step 1_.

## _recent-posts.yml_
### Some meta-information
The [_recent-posts.yml_ ‚ÑπÔ∏è](## "it176131/.github/workflows/recent-posts.yml") is a _workflow_ file.
It has an optional
[`name`](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/writing-workflows/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#name) to help
identify it in the GitHub UI.

```yaml
name: "Update README with most recent blog post"
```

|------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| ![Workflow Name in GitHub UI 1]({{ page.images | relative_url }}/gh_action_workflow_ui1.png) |![Workflow Name in GitHub UI 2]({{ page.images | relative_url }}/gh_action_workflow_ui2.png)|

Workflow files run when triggered by an event.
Those "events"
are defined via the required [`on`](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/writing-workflows/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#on) keyword.
```yaml
on:
```

This particular workflow has two types of triggering events:
- a [`schedule`](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/writing-workflows/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#onschedule) that runs every five minutes (though I'll probably change that),

```yaml
   schedule:
    - cron: "* * * * *"
```

- and a [`push`](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/writing-workflows/choosing-when-your-workflow-runs/events-that-trigger-workflows#push) to either the "main" or "master" [`branches`](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/writing-workflows/choosing-when-your-workflow-runs/events-that-trigger-workflows#running-your-workflow-only-when-a-push-to-specific-branches-occurs)

```yaml
  push:
    branches: ["main", "master"]
```

They are combined under the same `on`:
```yaml
on:
  push:
    branches: ["main", "master"]

  schedule:
     - cron: "* * * * *"
```

When a workflow is triggered, it has to do one or more things.
Those things are called [`jobs`](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/writing-workflows/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#jobs).
This workflow has one job with the [`<job_id>`](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/writing-workflows/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#jobsjob_id),
`recent_post_job`.
It has the more human-readable [`name`](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/writing-workflows/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#jobsjob_idname), "Recent Post," which is what we see in the GitHub UI,

|-------------------------------------------|---------------------------------|
| ![Job Name in GitHub UI 1]({{ page.images | relative_url }}/gh_job_ui1.png) | ![Job Name in GitHub UI 2]({{ page.images | relative_url }}/gh_job_ui2.png)|

and it [`runs-on`](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/writing-workflows/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#jobsjob_idruns-on) the [latest version of Ubuntu](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-github-hosted-runners/using-github-hosted-runners/about-github-hosted-runners#standard-github-hosted-runners-for-public-repositories).
```yaml
jobs:
  recent_post_job:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    name: Recent Post
```

Now for the moment we've all been waiting for...
### Step 1
> [_recent-posts.yml_ ‚ÑπÔ∏è](## "it176131/.github/workflows/recent-posts.yml") checks out the repository, giving it access to [_README.md_ ‚ÑπÔ∏è](## "it176131/README.md").

Each [`step`](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/writing-workflows/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#jobsjob_idsteps) under our `recent_post_job` has a [`name`](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/writing-workflows/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#jobsjob_idstepsname),
and _step 1_'s name is "Checkout repo."

To add, delete, modify, and even read a file in the repository requires it to be checked out.
_Step 1_ [`uses`](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/writing-workflows/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#jobsjob_idstepsuses) the GitHub action
[`actions/checkout@v4`](https://github.com/actions/checkout?tab=readme-ov-file#checkout-v4) to do this.
I won't get to in the weeds here,
but if you don't do this step, you won't be able to do anything with the _README.md_.
```yaml
jobs:
  recent_post_job:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    name: Recent Post
    steps:
      - name: Checkout repo
        uses: actions/checkout@v4
```

### Step 2

```yaml
name: "Update README with most recent blog post"
on:
  push:
    branches: ["main", "master"]

  schedule:
    - cron: "* * * * *"

jobs:
  recent_post_job:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    name: Recent Post
    steps:
      - name: Checkout repo
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Recent post action
        uses: "it176131/it176131.github.io/.github/actions/recent-posts@recent-posts"
        with:
          readme: "./README.md"
          num-entries: 5

      - name: Commit README
        run: |
          git config user.email github-actions@github.com
          git config user.name github-actions
          has_diff=$(git diff main --name-only -- README.md)
          if [ $has_diff ]; then
            git add README.md
            git commit -m "Synced and updated with most recent it176131.github.io blog post"
            git push
          fi
```

# Step 3:
The Docker container produced by `it176131.github.io/.github/actions/recent-posts/Dockerfile`:
- Installs Python 3.13
- Copies `it176131.github.io/.github/actions/recent-posts/requirements.txt` to its container directory and installs its contents
- Copies the remaining files in `it176131.github.io/.github/actions/recent-posts/` to its container directory
- Declares the `ENTRYPOINT` `python /main.py` and submits the argument inputs to the `main.py` script

```dockerfile
FROM python:3.13

COPY requirements.txt ./
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

COPY . ./

ENTRYPOINT ["python", "/main.py"]
```

Docker Instructions in `Dockerfile`:
- [`FROM`](https://docs.docker.com/reference/dockerfile/#from)
- [`COPY`](https://docs.docker.com/reference/dockerfile/#copy)
- [`RUN`](https://docs.docker.com/reference/dockerfile/#run)
- [`ENTRYPOINT`](https://docs.docker.com/reference/dockerfile/#entrypoint)

```text
httpx
pydantic-xml
typer
```

# Step 4
`it176131.github.io/.github/actions/recent-posts/main.py` takes the argument inputs and executes.

```python
from datetime import datetime

from typing import Annotated, Final

        ],
        num_entries: Annotated[
            int,
            Argument(help="Number of blog entries to write to the `readme`.")
        ],
) -> None:
    """Write most recent blog post metadata to ``readme``."""
    resp: Response = httpx.get(url=f"{BLOG_URL}/feed.xml")
    xml: bytes = resp.content
    model = Feed.from_xml(source=xml)
    entries = model.entries[:num_entries]

    with readme.open(mode="r") as f:
        text = f.read()

    pattern = r"(?<=<!-- BLOG START -->)[\S\s]*(?=<!-- BLOG END -->)"
    template = "- [{title}]({link}) by {author}"
    repl = "\n".join(
        [
            template.format(title=e.title, link=e.link, author=e.author)
            for e in entries
        ]
    )
    new_text = re.sub(pattern=pattern, repl=f"\n{repl}\n", string=text)
    with readme.open(mode="w") as f:
        f.write(new_text)


if __name__ == "__main__":
    app()

```

# Step 5
If `it176131.github.io/.github/actions/recent-posts/main.py` completes successfully,
`it176131/.github/workflows/recent-posts.yml` runs the "Commit README" step.
This involves `git` configuring the user to be "github-actions",
checking if the README.md has been modified, and if it has then add, commit, and push.
If it hasn't, end the step.
