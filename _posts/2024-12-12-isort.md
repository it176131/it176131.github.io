While reviewing some pull requests at work, I noticed that the imports were kind of... all over the place.
```python
# A made-up example.
from . import local_module
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np


def some_func() -> None:
    from collections import Counter
    ...
    from itertools import chain
    ...

```
I can't fault any single author for this, it just happens over time.
