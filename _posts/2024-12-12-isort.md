While reviewing pull requests (PRs) at work, I sometimes notice that the imports are kind of... all over the place.
```python
# A made-up example.

from itertools import chain
from . import local_module
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np


def some_func() -> None:
    from collections import Counter
    ...
    from itertools import chain
    ...

```
I can't fault any single author for this, it just happens over time.
To help myself and future authors of the codebase,
I try to make suggestions that make it easier to read or add a bit more structure.

On a recent PR I made the suggestion to use [`isort`](https://pycqa.github.io/isort/) on all the modified files.
Then it occurred to me that if there were more than a few modified files, this could be quite tedious!
To do this more lazily—er,
I mean _efficiently_!—I could take advantage of [`git`](https://git-scm.com/) to get a list of modified files
and feed them to `isort` as arguments.

# `git` the modified files

`git` tracks changes to files and writes those as [`commit`](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-commit)s to a [`log`](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-log).
