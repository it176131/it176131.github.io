I've been thinking long and hard about what to put in this post.
I considered doing something similar to my first post of January 2024,
[_New Year_]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _posts/2024-01-01-new-year.md %}), but I want it to be better somehow.

I considered adding a "Goals" section at the end.
Figured if I made them public, then maybe people would cheer me on and ask about my progress.
Something akin to OKRs.

On December 30, 2024, I wrote this list of goals that I wanted to complete in 2025:
- Purchase two properties
- Hire an accountant to manage my business expenses
- Consult an attorney to navigate real estate business laws
- Add my mom to my business as a part owner
- Transfer my most recent property title to my business
- Read 22 books
- Publish 20 blog posts
- Answer six Stack Overflow questions
- Push my total asset worth to $2.25 million
