I've been thinking long and hard about what to put in this post.
I considered doing something similar to my first post of January 2024,
[_New Year_]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _posts/2024-01-01-new-year.md %}), but I want it to be better somehow.

I considered adding a "Goals" section at the end.
Figured if I made them public, then maybe people would cheer me on and ask about my progress.
Something akin to OKRs.

On December 30, 2024, I wrote this list of goals that I wanted to complete in 2025:
- Purchase two properties
- Hire an accountant to manage my business expenses
- Consult an attorney to navigate real estate business laws
- Add my mom to my business as a part owner
- Transfer my most recent property title to my business
- Read 22 books
- Publish 20 blog posts
- Answer six Stack Overflow questions
- Increase my total asset worth to $2.25 million

After reading [_10x is Easier than 2x_](https://10xeasierbook.com/), I'm not sure I still believe in some of these goals.
I think I need to sit down and _**<u>really</u>**_ think about what I want and come up with options for how to get "it."

I'm trying to find things to add to my blog post and I'm struggling for the month of January.
Maybe I should move away from the bullet points for each month and instead write about my "wins" and "losses"?

What are my wins?
- My patent application made it through H&R Block's internal review process and was submitted to the United States Patent and Trademark Office.
- I published 19 blog posts. Most were technical writeups documenting a solution I came up with to a problem I was trying to solve.
- I read 21 books, beating my official goal by three.
- I purchased my first official investment/rental property with my mom and supervised my first minor renovation project.
- I fully recovered from my accident and got back to the boulder gym. Towards the end of the year I finally got back to where I left off and completed a V7, my first since before my accident.
