I've been thinking long and hard about what to put in this post.
I considered doing something similar to my first post of January 2024,
[_New Year_]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _posts/2024-01-01-new-year.md %}), but I want it to be better somehow.

I considered adding a "Goals" section at the end.
Figured if I made them public, then maybe people would cheer me on and ask about my progress.
Something akin to [OKR](https://www.whatmatters.com/faqs/okr-meaning-definition-example)s.

On December 30, 2024, I wrote this list of goals that I wanted to complete in 2025:
> - Purchase two properties
> - Hire an accountant to manage my business expenses
> - Consult an attorney to navigate real estate business laws
> - Add my mom to my business as co-owner
> - Transfer my most recent property title to my real estate business
> - Read 22 books
> - Publish 20 blog posts
> - Answer six Stack Overflow questions
> - Increase my total assets to $2.25 million

After reading [_10x is Easier than 2x_](https://10xeasierbook.com/),
I'm not sure if I still believe in some of these goals.
Most, if not all, of them feel more like to-do items on a checklist.
I think I need to sit down and _**<u>really</u>**_ think about what I want and come up with options for how to get "it."

Moving away from the monthly bullet points, I've decided to write about my "wins" and "losses" of 2024.

What are my wins?
- My patent application made it through H&R Block's internal review process and was submitted to the United States Patent and Trademark Office.
- I published 19 blog posts. Most were technical writeups documenting a solution I came up with to a problem I was trying to solve.
- I read 21 books, beating my official goal by three.
- I purchased my first official investment/rental property with my mom and supervised my first minor renovation project.
- I fully recovered from my accident and got back to the boulder gym. Towards the end of the year I finally got back to where I left off and completed a V7, my first since before my accident.

What about my losses?
Can I, or should I, call them losses?
If I don't call them losses, what are they?
Challenges?
Things I'm not proud of?
Experiences with a less to be learned?

Regardless of what I call them, I feel I should still talk about them because they show what not to do in the future.
Or rather if I should do something differently.

I'll call them "areas for improvement":
- My blog post, [_Basket Analysis, Part I: Navigating the API_"]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _posts/2024-05-07-basket-analysis-pt1.html %}). I'm not proud of this post, and I keep it on my blog as a reminder to not write something similar. I think it's because it doesn't talk about basket analysis at all, and that I called it "Part I" without ever writing a "Part II." Not that I didn't try, but "Part II" just didn't flow. After I published "Part I" and gave up on "Part II" I looked at what was working for me. That included writing about problems I was actively or had recvently solved, or follow-ups to questions or comments from an eralier post, like [_scikit-learn's Pipeline and Friends, Part II: Efficient Fitting_]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _posts/2024-02-17-sklearn-pipeline-pt2.html%}) or [_Contributing, Part II: Test-Driven Development_]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _posts/2024-03-24-contributing-pt2.md %}).
- Overspending on my investment property. This isn't exactly a "loss" as I did get the property for less than the asking price AND was able to get most of my closing costs covered by the seller, but I feel I could have done better. There's a saying that goes something like, "time in the market beats timing the market," which I agree with. But it's not as straightforward or easy as it sounds. Buying a property for too high a price and renting it out still puts you in the market, but not in as good of a position as someone who got it for less. I'm challenging myself to get a better deal on the next property as measured by some metrics I haven't yet decided on.
- I have time to read more books. Reading 21 books in a yuear is probably above average, but I feel I could read more. My official goal for 2025 is 22 (always one more than the previous year), but my unofficial goal is 24. That's two books a month, or one book approximately every 15 days. Now I don't read just any books. No. I typically read nonfiction with the intention of learning something about the world, or myself. This doesn't mean I don't read an occasional fiction book; my sister is a big Stephen King fan and I discovered that I really liked [_The Shining_](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11588.The_Shining) last year.
- More blog posts. this ties to my first area for improvement in that "more" should also imply "better." I wrote 19 posts last year which is actually quite a few more than I thought I'd write. This year I'd officially like to write 20 (again, always one more than the previous year), but unofficially I want to write 24. I intend to keep the majority of my posts technical with the hope that they help people solve a problem, or act as a resource to my future self. However, to improve them I may branch out and write about some other topics like my thoughts on a book I just finished or my journey in real estate. Whatever they are, I want them to be better. And I plan on measuring that by looking at analytics.
- Climb a V8+ boulder route at my gym. Before my accident I had just broken into the V7 routes at my gym. I completed three, and on my to complete my fourth I broke my arm. Nine months after recovery I finally sent another V7. Then ten days later I sent another. A couple weeks after that I sent my third (the first of 2025) and another couple weeks after that my fourth. I feel so much more confident working on V7 routes that I actively look for them on the walls and am willing to spend four days projecting. I'd like to push myself and go to the next level, which would put me in the top climbing difficulty at my gym. Along the way I hope to do my first muscle-up (I think it comes down to form), hit 30 consecutive pull-ups, and do a handstand push-up.

I've got a lot of goals/areas for improvement this year.
To keep me honest, I'd appreciate any feedback and support from my readers,
and I'll post regular updates on all of my goals.
Heck, I'll even make a dashboard and put it on my blog site and GitHub profile.
Year.
I like that idea ðŸ™‚.
