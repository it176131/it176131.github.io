title: "Actions & Workflows: Automatically Updating My GitHub Profile with Recent Blog Posts"
date: 2025-01-18
---

First post of 2025!

I ended 2024 with my post, [_pydantic-xml: Parsing My RSS Feed_]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _posts/2024-12-23-pydantic-xml.md %}),
and mentioned that I was trying to add my most recent blog post to my GitHub profile using a custom GitHub action and workflow.
I'm happy to share that after a couple of weeks, I figured it out. 😎

I won't bore you with every struggle I experienced.
Instead, I'll share what files I had to create,
how they interact with each other from a high level,
and then give a (mostly) line-by-line breakdown of the important stuff.

# The files
All together, I created four new files and modified two others:

|          | File                                                             |
|----------|------------------------------------------------------------------|
| New      | action.yml<br>Dockerfile<br>recent-posts.yml<br>requirements.txt |
| Modified | main.py<br>README.md                                             |

The files are across two repos,
my [blog repo](https://github.com/it176131/it176131.github.io) and my [profile repo](https://github.com/it176131/it176131).
This organizes things and allows me
to keep the [_action_](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/about-github-actions/understanding-github-actions#actions) in the blog repo,
and the [_workflow_](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/about-github-actions/understanding-github-actions#workflows) in the profile repo.

Here is the layout of my two repos.
```
📂 it176131.github.io  # blog repo
└── 📂 .github
    └── 📂 actions
        └── 📂 recent-posts
            ├── 🔧 action.yml  # The action metadata file
            ├── 🐋 Dockerfile  # Instructions to build the Docker container
            ├── 🐍 main.py  # Python script to update the input (README.md)
            └── 📄 requirements.txt  # Python package dependencies for main.py

📂 it176131  # profile repo
├── 📂 .github
│   └── 📂 workflows
│       └── 🔧 recent-posts.yml  # The workflow file
└── 📓 README.md  # My "profile"
```

# The interactions
There are six interactions among the files that result in the `README.md` being updated.
Because the files have unique names, I will reference them as if they were local to each other.
For example, I will reference `it176131/.github/workflows/recent-posts.yml` as `recent-posts.yml`.
> For your convenience, each file name will have a [tooltip ℹ️](## "Hover over the filenames") with the full path so you can keep them straight 😉.

1. [`recent-posts.yml` ℹ️](## "it176131/.github/workflows/recent-posts.yml") checks out the repository, giving it access to [`README.md` ℹ️](## "it176131/README.md").
2. [`recent-posts.yml` ℹ️](## "it176131/.github/workflows/recent-posts.yml") calls [`action.yml` ℹ️](## "it176131.github.io/.github/actions/recent-posts/action.yml") with inputs `readme` (default [`README.md` ℹ️](## "it176131/README.md")) and `num-entries` (default `5`).
3. [`action.yml` ℹ️](## "it176131.github.io/.github/actions/recent-posts/action.yml") informs GitHub
   to build a Docker container using the [`Dockerfile` ℹ️](## "it176131.github.io/.github/actions/recent-posts/Dockerfile").
4. The Docker container produced by [`Dockerfile` ℹ️](## "it176131.github.io/.github/actions/recent-posts/Dockerfile") installs the packages in [`requirements.txt` ℹ️](## "it176131.github.io/.github/actions/recent-posts/requirements.txt") and runs [`main.py` ℹ️](## "it176131.github.io/.github/actions/recent-posts/main.py") with the inputs from *step 1*.
5. [`main.py` ℹ️](## "it176131.github.io/.github/actions/recent-posts/main.py") takes the inputs and updates the [`README.md` ℹ️](## "it176131/README.md") with the latest posts.
6. [`recent-posts.yml` ℹ️](## "it176131/.github/workflows/recent-posts.yml") checks if [`README.md` ℹ️](## "it176131/README.md") has been modified, commiting and pushing any changes.

That's quite a bit of interaction.
Let's open up the files and see what's going on under the hood.

# The README.md
```markdown
# Recent Articles From My [Blog](https://it176131.github.io/) ✍
<!-- BLOG START -->
<!-- BLOG END -->
```

# Step 2:
`it176131.github.io/.github/actions/recent-posts/action.yml` spins up a Docker 
container using `it176131.github.io/.github/actions/recent-posts/Dockerfile` 
and supplies the argument inputs from `it176131/.github/workflows/recent-posts.yml`.

{% raw %}
```yaml
name: "Recent Posts"
author: "Ian Thompson"
description: "Get the most recent blog post metadata."
inputs:
  readme:
    description: "Path to the README.md"
    required: false
    default: "./README.md"

  num-entries:
    description: "Number of blog entries to show"
    required: false
    default: 5

runs:
  using: "docker"
  image: "Dockerfile"
  args:
    - ${{ inputs.readme }}
    - ${{ inputs.num-entries }}
```
{% endraw %}

# Step 3:
The Docker container produced by `it176131.github.io/.github/actions/recent-posts/Dockerfile`:
- Installs Python 3.13
- Copies `it176131.github.io/.github/actions/recent-posts/requirements.txt` to its container directory and installs its contents
- Copies the remaining files in `it176131.github.io/.github/actions/recent-posts/` to its container directory
- Declares the `ENTRYPOINT` `python /main.py` and submits the argument inputs to the `main.py` script

```dockerfile
FROM python:3.13

COPY requirements.txt ./
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

COPY . ./

ENTRYPOINT ["python", "/main.py"]
```

Docker Instructions in `Dockerfile`:
- [`FROM`](https://docs.docker.com/reference/dockerfile/#from)
- [`COPY`](https://docs.docker.com/reference/dockerfile/#copy)
- [`RUN`](https://docs.docker.com/reference/dockerfile/#run)
- [`ENTRYPOINT`](https://docs.docker.com/reference/dockerfile/#entrypoint)

```text
httpx
pydantic-xml
typer
```

# Step 4
`it176131.github.io/.github/actions/recent-posts/main.py` takes the argument inputs and executes.

```python
from datetime import datetime
import re
from typing import Annotated, Final

import httpx
from httpx import Response
from pydantic.networks import HttpUrl
from pydantic.types import FilePath
from pydantic_xml.model import (
    attr, BaseXmlModel, computed_element, element, wrapped
)
from typer import Typer
from typer.params import Argument

BLOG_URL = "https://it176131.github.io"
NSMAP: Final[dict[str, str]] = {"": "http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom"}
app = Typer()


class Entry(BaseXmlModel, tag="entry", nsmap=NSMAP, search_mode="ordered"):
    """A blog post entry from the RSS feed."""

    title: str = element()
    relative_url: str = wrapped(path="link", entity=attr(name="href"))
    published: datetime = element()
    updated: datetime = element()
    author: str = wrapped(path="author/name")

    @computed_element
    def link(self: "Entry") -> HttpUrl:
        """Resolve <entry.link[href]> to full URL."""
        return HttpUrl(url=f"{BLOG_URL}{self.relative_url}")


class Feed(BaseXmlModel, tag="feed", nsmap=NSMAP, search_mode="ordered"):
    """Validate the RSS feed/XML from my blog."""

    # We collect all <entry> tags from the RSS feed.
    entries: list[Entry]


@app.command()
def main(
        readme: Annotated[
            FilePath,
            Argument(help="Path to file where metadata will be written.")
        ],
        num_entries: Annotated[
            int,
            Argument(help="Number of blog entries to write to the `readme`.")
        ],
) -> None:
    """Write most recent blog post metadata to ``readme``."""
    resp: Response = httpx.get(url=f"{BLOG_URL}/feed.xml")
    xml: bytes = resp.content
    model = Feed.from_xml(source=xml)
    entries = model.entries[:num_entries]

    with readme.open(mode="r") as f:
        text = f.read()

    pattern = r"(?<=<!-- BLOG START -->)[\S\s]*(?=<!-- BLOG END -->)"
    template = "- [{title}]({link}) by {author}"
    repl = "\n".join(
        [
            template.format(title=e.title, link=e.link, author=e.author)
            for e in entries
        ]
    )
    new_text = re.sub(pattern=pattern, repl=f"\n{repl}\n", string=text)
    with readme.open(mode="w") as f:
        f.write(new_text)


if __name__ == "__main__":
    app()

```

# Step 5
If `it176131.github.io/.github/actions/recent-posts/main.py` completes successfully,
`it176131/.github/workflows/recent-posts.yml` runs the "Commit README" step.
This involves `git` configuring the user to be "github-actions",
checking if the README.md has been modified, and if it has then add, commit, and push.
If it hasn't, end the step.
