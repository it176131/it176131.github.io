First post of 2025!

I ended 2024 with my post, [_pydantic-xml: Parsing My RSS Feed_]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _posts/2024-12-23-pydantic-xml.md %}),
and mentioned that I was trying to add my most recent blog post to my GitHub profile using a custom GitHub action and workflow.
I'm happy to share that after a couple of weeks, I figured it out. ðŸ˜Ž
