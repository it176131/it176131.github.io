Every now and then I'll see a question on [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/){:target="_blank"} with a nice little directory tree.
I've tried to make one before on my Windows machine, but it never turns out as pretty as I want.

Lately I've found myself browsing the [Calm Code](https://calmcode.io/){:target="_blank"} website picking little tidbits.
In one of my more recent ventures I came across [`rich`](https://github.com/Textualize/rich){:target="_blank"},
and I've started to integrate it into my notebooks because it makes everything a little more... âœ¨richâœ¨.

While exploring the [`rich` tutorial](https://calmcode.io/course/rich/introduction){:target="_blank"} on Calm Code,
I learned that it can create *really* nice looking directory trees.
As Vincentâ€”the Calm Code creatorâ€”says in his [video](https://calmcode.io/course/rich/trees){:target="_blank"},
you can find an example tree on [his GitHub profile](https://github.com/koaning){:target="_blank"}.

I really like this tree structure.
I don't know when I'll need one, but I decided to learn how to make one just in case I ever do. ðŸ¤·
