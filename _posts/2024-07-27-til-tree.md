Throughout my career I've rocked a Windows machine.
I don't mind them most of the time, but sometimes I wish I was on a linux machine instead (don't get me started on Apple).

As a data scientist I use the command line quite a bit.
Maybe it's because I enjoy hotkeys and shortcuts so much.
Or maybe it's because I'm constantly looking for ways to make a system more efficient—myself included.

Don't get me wrong, I love my mouse (it has quite a few more buttons than average),
but I've got 10 fingers and if that means I can do things 2x faster than with the mouse—I'm going to.

The linux terminal comes preinstalled with some bash commands: `ls`, `pwd`, `grep`, etc.
Windows has its own naming conventions that I've never really gotten used to, and I get around it by installing [git-bash](https://git-scm.com/downloads).
