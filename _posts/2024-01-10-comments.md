I debated on whether to allow comments on my posts.
But after some deliberation, I figured it'd be okay‚ÄîI can always remove the option later.
Without further ado, here's my journey to enabling comments.

# Is it possible?
After a quick google search, it turns out it is!
I came across [this question](https://webapps.stackexchange.com/q/165528/321142) on the [Web Applications Stack Exchange](https://webapps.stackexchange.com/), and I was greeted with two contenders:
- [Utterances](https://utteranc.es/),
- and [Giscus](https://giscus.app/)

I started reading about Utterances first as it was mentioned in [the (only) answer](https://webapps.stackexchange.com/a/165529/321142)
(Giscus was mentioned in the [comments](https://webapps.stackexchange.com/questions/165528/how-to-add-comments-in-blog-posts-on-github-pages-websites#comment160794_165529).)

# Utterances
You can get this info from the [Utterances website](https://utteranc.es/), but I thought I'd highlight a couple of things for my own sake:
- Comments are created via GitHub [Issues](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/about-issues).
- The reader needs a GitHub account to comment.
- I (Ian, hello üëã) need to install the [utterances app](https://github.com/apps/utterances) to the [it176131.github.io repo](https://github.com/it176131/it176131.github.io) to allow users to comment
- I (me again) need to confirm that the repo's [_issues_ feature](https://github.com/it176131/it176131.github.io/settings) is turned on
- Blog posts can be mapped to issues in one of six different ways
- Utterance comments have their own theme
- Comments show up like this<br>

So far I'm liking it!
But what about Giscuss?
Why does it exist when Utterances seems to have solved the "Comments on GitHub Pages" question?

# Giscus
Again, you can get this info from the [Giscus website](https://giscus.app/).
Highlighting things for my own sake.
- Heavily inspired by [utterances](https://github.com/utterance/utterances)
- Comments are powered by [GitHub Discussions](https://docs.github.com/en/discussions)
- Giscus, GitHub Discussions and its API are all under active development
- The reader needs a GitHub account to comment
- I need to install the [giscus app](https://github.com/apps/giscus) to the repo to allow users to comment
- I need to confirm that the repo's [_Discussions_ feature](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/enabling-features-for-your-repository/enabling-or-disabling-github-discussions-for-a-repository) is turned on
- Pages can be mapped to discussions in one of six ways
- Giscus has a number of additional features including:
  - the ability to reaction to the post rather than individual comments (think "liking" a page)
  - the option to move the comment box to the top of the comments instead of leaving it at the bottom 
  (big fan after trying to comment on a page using Utterances)
  - Lazy loading of comments (i.e. don't load until scrolled into view)
- Giscus comments have their own theme
- Comments look similar to those on utterances
- This is what page reactions look like<br>

# Which one?
Sometimes all the fancy features can be a turn-off; they make me think setting up the software will be challenging.
I was going to invest in Utterances simplicity, 
but the final selling point for Giscus was the amount of activity in its repo.
Giscus had 6.4k Stars at the time of writing.
While Utterances had a couple thousand more (8.4k at the time of writing),
the [most recent commit](https://github.com/utterance/utterances/commit/9e79bdaaa48c0b83d224c58f132db317785103cd) was almost two years ago.
The [most recent commit](https://github.com/giscus/giscus/commit/6fb5f2764734a27402656cfa046b22f9ac108ae1) to Giscus was four days ago.
I choose Giscus‚Äî+1 ‚≠ê from me.

# Set up
I followed the instructions on [giscus.app](https://giscus.app/) under the **Repository** header.
1. ~~The repository is public...~~<br>
‚úÖ Has been from the beginning!

2. The [giscus](https://github.com/apps/giscus) app is installed...<br>
I decided to install the giscus app for only this repo.
I can always go back and change it later if I so choose.
After the installation I was taken to my [installations page](https://github.com/settings/installations).
Here you can find other apps you've installed to your GitHub repos.

3. The Discussions feature is turned on...
