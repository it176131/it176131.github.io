I use [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/) for most, if not all, of my development.
Professional edition at work.
Community edition for everywhere else.
There are some subtle differences between the two, but [project](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/setting-up-your-project.html) and [virtual environment](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/creating-virtual-environment.html) management are not.
