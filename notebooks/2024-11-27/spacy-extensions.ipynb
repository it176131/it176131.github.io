This lets you store additional information relevant to your application, add new features and functionality to spaCy, and implement your own models trained with other machine learning libraries. It also lets you take advantage of spaCy’s data structures and the `Doc` object as the “single source of truth”.\n",

    ">**Property extensions**. Define a getter and an optional setter function. If no setter is provided, the extension is immutable. Since the getter and setter functions are only called when you _retrieve_ the attribute, you can also access values of previously added attribute extensions. For example, a `Doc` getter can average over `Token` attributes. For `Span` extensions, you’ll almost always want to use a property—otherwise, you’d have to write to _every possible_ `Span` in the `Doc` to set up the values correctly."
